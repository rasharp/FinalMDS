Structure of sources is the following.
Main file of research is [Thesis brief](Thesis%20brief.ipynb), which contains imports for necessary modules

Modules used:
- [preprocess.py]() contain functions for data input and preprocessing. More info in preprocessing section. All preprocessing is consolidated in a [Preprocessing.ipynb]() notebook. More about data formats in preprocessing section.
- [tail_index.py]() contains some extra functions for tail exponent estimation. It is not used for CCDF method
- [simulation.py]() is main file for simple simulations. It heavily used numba for accelerating.
- [strategies.py]() is file with strategies classes. It used for advanced testing like history data and generated order book data.
- [generator.py]() contains order book generator class.

Also there are some intermediate research notebooks:
